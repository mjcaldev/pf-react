# My Renovated Portfolio

I am in the progress of shifting my previous portfolio site to this new project. Excited to get a more professional look that reflects the work I do on a regular basis.

**Link to project:**

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, JSX, Tailwind, React, and Vite.

I'll break down the sites structure and key features once I have it completed.

---

## Optimizations (optional)
My portfolio will always have optimizations as I plan to regularly upgrade it to reflect the new tech I work with.

---

## Lessons Learned:
I'll make sure to share this once the project is complete. One big lesson already is the importance of clean, compartmentalized components. Avoid having a bloated App.tsx!
